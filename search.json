    "text": "Towards Scalable Identification of Brick Kilns from Satellite Imagery with Active Learning \nIdentifying unlawfully built brick kilns is crucial for reducing their environmental footprint. Given the limited availability of Indian brick kiln data, we utilized transfer learning by refining models initially developed for Bangladesh data. The process of labeling brick kilns is laborious; hence, we leveraged active learning to annotate data points where the model demonstrated the greatest uncertainty. Using the refined model, we pinpointed more than 700 brick kilns in the Indo-Gangetic region, and we are extending this methodology to other areas across India.\n[Active NILM]\nIn the energy disaggregation domain, the scarcity of labeled data poses a significant challenge, primarily due to the need for appliance-specific sensors, which not only escalates costs but also raises privacy concerns during data collection. To tackle this issue, we employed an active learning strategy and drew upon the Pecan Street Dataport dataset, comprising 25 households in Austin, Texas, for our experimental framework. We achieved comparable performance to the existing works on energy disaggregation while utilizing just 65% of the available data. Various acquisition functions—including entropy, mutual information, rank-based sampling, and round-robin—were used in quantifying uncertainty throughout the process.\n[Data Agnostic Blind Image Restoration]\nContemporary deep learning techniques often falter when tasked with deblurring images outside the scope of their training dataset. Our aim is to pioneer a method adept at effectively deblurring a wide variety of image types. To achieve this, we embarked on an empirical exploration of diverse image restoration techniques. Through the integration of these methodologies, we developed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and tailored state-of-the-art methods to evaluate their versatility across multiple datasets. Currently, our focus is on the development of a novel CLIP-based StyleGAN approach.\n[Compiler]\nA Compiler built from scratch with Python, incorporating advanced techniques for lexical analysis, parsing, static type checking, optimization, and a user-friendly interface. Incorporated advanced features such as error handling and also introduced user defined variable types for incorporating different possibilities of writing programs.\n[Food Delivery WebApp]\nWe developed a web-based application dedicated to food delivery, utilizing Django and MySQL from the ground up. The application offers users the ability to either log in or sign up as customers, restaurants, or delivery agents. For customer convenience, it supports searches based on cuisine type, dishes, and restaurants, enhancing the overall user experience."
